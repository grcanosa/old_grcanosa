I'm Mouselimis Lampros and I hold a degree in business administration from the university tuebingen, germany. In the last years I successfully completed many MOOCs (massive open online courses) in machine learning and data science. A detailed list can be found [here](/images/mooc_list.html). <br> I do like sports like running, cycling, swimming, tennis playing. From time to time I take part in kaggle competitions to improve my coding skills and to learn about new machine learning methods. My feature plans are to write a dissertation in machine learning and participate in data science projects.
